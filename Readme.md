What I’d refactor immediately after MAIN OCR works

Order matters:
Hard OCR gate (single line change)
Vehicle-level OCR cooldown
Plate confidence cache
Disable SUB OCR forever
Lower MAIN burst FPS
Move debug dumps behind env flag
No infra changes yet — just logic.

TARGET:
₹0.20–₹0.50 per 1,000 vehicle passes
(depending on OCR backend)
